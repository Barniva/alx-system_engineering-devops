## Description
At ALX School `we do hard things`, the goal is not to be a good student rather the key goal is to be a good software Engineer. ALX_africa are on a mission to identify, develop and equip Africaâ€™s next 3 million leaders. We have projects everyday that we have to push on GitHub in order for an automatic review to be done by `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`. This repository contains directories each corresponding to a software engineering or DevOps project. These projects are part of the ALX Software Engineering year 1 curriculum. In these projects, we cover everything from the basics of the Linux Shell, Bash commands, Bash scripting, networking, APIs, and web-stack debugging to more advanced topics.
